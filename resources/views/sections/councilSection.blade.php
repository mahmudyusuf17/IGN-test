    <h3>Global Public Health Emergency in Response to Coronavirus Outbreak</h3>
    <p>The battle against Coronavirus Outbreak (COVID-19) is still ongoing. Per 14 September 2020, more than 28 million cases have been reported with more than 900 thousand deaths confirmed worldwide. The virus has affected the whole world in so many ways, including healthcare, social and the economy. Regardless of the wide impact, winning the battle against the virus is still a world-first priority in order to bring all the other aspects back to normal. Some countries have successfully managed to have 0 cases while some others confirm more than 3.000 new cases per day. As much as the vaccine is needed, the research and testing process is still ongoing with 0 vaccines approved for full use, 38 vaccines in clinical trials on humans, and at least 93 preclinical vaccines are under active investigation in animals (per 13 September 2020). In the midst of scientists racing to produce a safe and effective vaccine by next year, what are the emergency responses to combat or (at least) slow down the spread of the virus?</p>

    <h3>Protection of Marine Ecosystem During Reclamation</h3>
    <p>Reclamation has been done in many parts of the world to accommodate the needs of bigger population and seem to be economically advantageous. However, reclamation causes detrimental impacts to the environment, especially the marine ecosystem. Each project causes destruction to underwater habitats by building over or enclosing a body of water. Unfortunately, the past or current damage is irreversible. The only thing member states can do is stopping such thing from happening in the future or create a set of frameworks on how to make marine ecosystem protection and reclamation go hand in hand.</p>

    <p>The issue of COVID-19 is not just about the virus and health issue. It also creates many negative impacts to social issue, especially education. Due to the rapid spread of the virus, many countries have implemented lockdown or physical distancing. It means millions of children around the world are out of school. To counter the problem, schools have conducted online learning by using teleconference technology. However, there are still many other countries which open its public facilities, including schools to ensure the children are getting education as planned. In regard to those situations, the question is how to ensure the quality of online learning and the safety of offline learning?</p>

    <h3>Protecting the Rights of Informal Slum Dwellers through Improved and More Inclusive Urban Governance</h3>
    <p>Cities hold enormous potential for humanity and dreams for people to have a better life. However, the case is different for 800 million unfortunate people living in slum areas. Survival is a daily struggle for many slum dwellers who often lack access to basic services, such as clean water and sanitation to name the least. Their vulnerability also presents in the form of a lack of secure property rights, exploitation by vested interests or criminal gangs, environmental hazards and labor hazards of informal work. The demand for inclusive urban governance is not a tertiary agenda, rather it is an issue of humanity and human right uphold.</p>

    <h3>Addressing the Emergence of Cryptocurrency</h3>
    <p>The growing popularity of digital currency has played an integral role in the emergence of cryptocurrency, a virtual asset designed to work as a medium of exchange enabling individuals to transmit value in a digital setting. Countries around the world have been taking various stances on this matter. Some countries have issued laws or policies on the subject to regulate the system, some countries refuse to acknowledge it as a legal currency and some others refuse to acknowledge the existence of it. The different standpoint comes from the pro and cons presented in cryptocurrency and its market. The problem does not only come from the problematic system, it is also being used for money laundering and terrorists financial transactions.</p>

    <p>Children are the future of the world and deserve the best to optimize their potential. However, 5.1 million children are facing multiple rights violations, from exclusion from education to declination of participation in the communities because they have disabilities. The focus is on correcting “defects” on the disabilities, rather than changing attitude by being supportive in reaching their potential, prevails. The society fails to see their potential. Not that the children are unable, they just have different kind of capabilities which await the world to explore. Thus, UNICEF is there to help every child, including to ensure the well-being of children with disabilities in reaching their full potential.</p>

    <p>Water is one of the most fundamental elements for the survival of all living organisms on earth. Not only for household consumption, but water is also the basic necessity for agriculture to municipal and industrial. However, the accessibility and constant supply of freshwater have become major issues. The Mediterranean basin has been identified as one of the world’s most vulnerable regions to climatic and anthropogenic changes with water scarcity and drought have been identified in the region.

    <h3>The Challenges Faced by the Ummah to Counter Foreign Domination: Women Empowerment in Muslim World</h3>
    <p>Women have always had a special place in Islam. Thus, OIC has always been committed to ensure women’s empowerment. It includes enhancing women’s participation in decision-making, providing quality education, providing health care, and economic empowerment, social protection, protection of women from violence, and protection of women in crisis and disaster. However, the way Islamic countries honoring women is not the same as how western countries are demonstrating. With the spreading of western feminist value, OIC should come up with a better set of approaches to empower women while upholding Islamic values.</p>

    <h3>Addressing the Emerging Rivalries in Technology, Cyber Security, and Artificial Intelligence</h3>
    <p>With the rapidly evolving innovation and technology, rivalry or crime in the cyber and artificial intelligence niche has brought several concerns. One trend identified is a shift from malware targeting computer to attacks targeting mobile devices which results in criminals remotely access victims’ personal mobile systems and information. Not only causing serious harm on a personal level, it also threatens businesses and government security. This only proves the development of cyberthreats is interminable unless all countries are acting fast in providing measures for prevention and mitigation while showing commitment to its implementation.</p>

    <h3>Modernizing Agricultural System to Achieve Food Security</h3>
    <p>Food security is the goal of every country and apparently the world as a whole. With the increasing demand for food for a growing population as well as rising hunger and malnutrition, food security is harder yet more urgent to achieve. However, food production system, especially in the agricultural sector worldwide is facing unprecedented challenges, such as adverse climate change effects, overexploitation of natural resources, and loss of biodiversity. One of the most feasible ways to achieve food security is by adapting to the changing nature and making agricultural systems resilient through modernization.</p>

    <h3>Protection of Marine Ecosystem During Reclamation</h3>
    <p>Reclamation has been done in many parts of the world to accommodate the needs of bigger population and seem to be economically advantageous. However, reclamation causes detrimental impacts to the environment, especially the marine ecosystem. Each project causes destruction to underwater habitats by building over or enclosing a body of water. Unfortunately, the past or current damage is irreversible. The only thing member states can do is stopping such thing from happening in the future or create a set of frameworks on how to make marine ecosystem protection and reclamation go hand in hand.</p>

    <h3>Proliferation of Nuclear Weapon and the Stability of South Asia</h3>
    <p>Nuclear weapon is renowned to be mass destruction which may cause thousands of death and permanent injuries to the survivors. Hiroshima and Nagasaki are the proofs of how destructive it can be. Yet, a nuclear weapon is still proliferated in many parts of the world, including South Asia. The proliferation of nuclear weapons in South Asia arises as to the consequence of a security dilemma involving China, India, Pakistan, also US, and Russia to a greater extend. Each country claims its policy of nuclear proliferation is a self-defense mechanism leading to racing in nuclear arsenal expansion. In addition to the problem, it has been confirmed that non-state actors, such as terrorist and extremist groups, are also into the realm of proliferation.</p>

    <h3>Ensuring the Well-Being of Children with Disabilities</h3>
    <p>Children are the future of the world and deserve the best to optimize their potential. However, 5.1 million children are facing multiple rights violations, from exclusion from education to declination of participation in the communities because they have disabilities. The focus is on correcting “defects” on the disabilities, rather than changing attitude by being supportive in reaching their potential, prevails. The society fails to see their potential. Not that the children are unable, they just have different kind of capabilities which await the world to explore. Thus, UNICEF is there to help every child, including to ensure the well-being of children with disabilities in reaching their full potential.</p>

    <p>Many countries of the world are shutting down their door preventing the virus to spread. The world is suffering from many issues caused by COVID-19 Pandemic. It makes everyone vulnerable and prone to health, social, and economic issues to name a few. Sadly, vulnerable populations who have been suffering even before COVID-19 existed, such as refugees, are facing more hardship than ever before. Not only starvation, education, or other well-being issues, now they are prone to catch the virus as there is no guarantee refugee camps are free from Coronavirus. The concern is whether the healthcare services provided in the camp sufficient to handle such cases. If not, where will they receive their treatment? Just like during other disasters, refugees always seem to be forgotten.</p>

    <h3>Protection and Justice for the Victim of Sexual Harassment</h3>
    <p>All individuals have the right to feel safe and secure, including women. However, the issue of sexual harassment has always been around with the rising number of cases. Even though it is a common understanding that no harassment is justifiable, sexual harassment keeps on happening, especially toward women. Sadly, not all member states have been showing the same commitment to addressing this issue, especially in protecting and serving justice for the victim of sexual harassment. Many victims of sexual harassment are facing hardship socially and psychologically. In addition, many perpetrators are not subjected to any legal charges which give no deterrent effect to prevent similar case to happen.</p>
